# Electric-Vehicles-SQL-Analysis
Electric Vehicles SQL Analysis Project Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of electric vehicle specifications using SQL. The goal is to explore, summarize, and find insights from the data to better understand how different electric vehicles compare in terms of battery capacity, range, acceleration, and efficiency.

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains information on 478 electric vehicles with the following key features:

Brand and model

Battery capacity (kWh)

Vehicle range (km)

Acceleration (0-100 km/h)

Top speed

Drivetrain type

Car body type

Fast charging capabilities

Other technical specifications

# What This Project Does

Using SQL queries, this project:

Calculates average battery capacity by brand

Compares average acceleration by drivetrain type

Analyzes average driving range by car body type

Checks for missing data in important columns

Calculates correlation coefficients to understand relationships between battery capacity, range, and acceleration

Identifies outlier vehicles with unusually high battery capacity or low range

Ranks vehicles by efficiency (kilometers per kWh)

Summarizes vehicle performance based on fast charging port type

# Why This Project is Useful
Helps electric vehicle manufacturers and buyers understand performance trends.

Provides insights into how different vehicle features relate to efficiency and speed.

Demonstrates practical use of SQL for real-world data analysis.

Can be a foundation for further analysis or integration with visualization and machine learning.

# How to Use This Project
Run the provided SQL scripts on your own SQL database with the dataset loaded.

Modify or extend the queries to explore other questions about electric vehicles
.
Use the insights to support research, product development, or data-driven decisions.
